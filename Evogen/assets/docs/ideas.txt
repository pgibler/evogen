Bugs:
1) Blocking doesn't seem to work properly. I'll get to it.
2) After an unknown amount of generations, all characters end up being the exact same. I'll have to log whats going on but I didn't get to it.

Some ideas to improve:
1) Adjust ratio for top player from 2/3rds to 1/2 or 1/3rd.
2) Adjust fitness function from using just game wins to both game wins and life lost/game run time.
3) Make a top player (like you suggested a while ago) rather than randomly generating them all.
4) Punish characters who attack but don't deal damage by taking away health from them. I don't like how they ALWAYS seem to punch when they jump.
 	- I could also adjust this by having the player only choose a new action if BOTH their condition changes and
	  they are capable of performing an action. This might not seem realistic though but it may prevent this behavior.
5) Adjust hitboxes so the ground punch doesn't go "through" the other player
	- Also make hitboxes bigger.
6) Make it so they can't move through each other

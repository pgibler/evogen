# Evogen

Evogen is a combination of a simple fighting game system + a genetic algorithm library + an AI fighting trainer that uses the genetic algorithm library.

## Why make this?

Good question - it was made as part of a student project when I was attending Worcester Polytechnic Institute for my undergradute degree in Computer Science. The goal was to create a genetic algorithm that could be used to produce superior fighters in the context of a Street Fighter style 2D fighting game. It has all the code quality you would expect out of a student project. It works though.

## How does the genetic algorithm work?

The fighters are valued based on a set of criteria including whether they win fights and how much damage they do. The idea was to generate fighters that had above average levels of aggression.

## Can I use this?

Yes you can!

## How do I use this?

It must be built it using the FlexSDK.
